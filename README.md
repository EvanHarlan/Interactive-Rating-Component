## Usage
To use this component, follow these steps:

1. Copy the provided HTML code into your HTML file.
2. Link the provided CSS file (`style.css`) in the `<head>` section of your HTML file.
3. Include the provided JavaScript code (`index.js`) at the end of the `<body>` section of your HTML file.
4. Customize the content and styling as needed to match your specific requirements.

## HTML Structure
The HTML structure consists of two main sections:
